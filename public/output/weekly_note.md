# Weekly Product Pulse: Payments, KYC, and Statement Accuracy Concerns

## Overview
This week's pulse highlights significant friction points across Payments, KYC, and Statements. Payment issues dominate, ranging from stuck deposits and failed mobile recharges to UPI loading errors. KYC processes are frequently cited for technical errors and verification delays. Statement feedback points to incorrect return calculations (XIRR vs. Absolute) and reporting visibility issues, impacting user trust in portfolio tracking.

## Top 3 Themes
- **Payments: Significant failures noted in deposits, mobile recharges resulting in deducted but unfulfilled transactions, and UPI processing delays.**
- **KYC: Persistent issues with verification time-outs, technical errors during setup (especially for US trading), and slow reactivation processes.**
- **Statements: Users demand correct XIRR reporting for SIPs over absolute returns, and clearer P&L reporting regarding realized vs. unrealized gains.**

## User Quotes
> "My deposit has been stuck for 20+ days... No proper support, no resolution. I’m closing my account."
> "Mutual fund showing the absolute % rate which is not correct for SIP investment, it should show the XIRR returns."
> "After 22 minutes waiting for verification I feel totally waist of time... not recommend [for KYC]."

## Action Ideas
- 💡 Prioritize stabilizing the instant deposit/withdrawal module to eliminate stuck transactions and investigate root cause of failed mobile recharges.
- 💡 Launch an immediate audit of the KYC verification pipeline, focusing on reducing technical errors and setting transparent resolution SLAs for reactivations.
- 💡 Implement XIRR as the primary return metric for SIP investments within portfolio statements to align reporting accuracy with user expectations.
