# Weekly Product Pulse: KYC Friction and Payment Issues Dominate Feedback

## Overview
This week's feedback highlights significant user friction primarily concentrated in KYC verification processes and payment failures. While withdrawals are mentioned, KYC blocks and payment transaction errors (especially with UPI and failed recharges) are driving negative sentiment. Support response times for complex issues like KYC reactivation also require immediate attention to improve user confidence.

## Top 3 Themes
- **KYC: Persistent issues with verification, especially for international accounts and reactivation processes, leading to frustration.**
- **Payments: Recurring failures with UPI transactions, delays in mobile recharge processing, and instant deposit fees noted.**
- **Withdrawals: Occasional complaints regarding delays in fund settlement periods.**

## User Quotes
> "My federal account got blocked in kyc. Connecting indmoney is really hard as we have to create a ticket, we can't call them nor chat with their agent."
> "I recharged my mobile using your app, but it showed “pending” even though the money was deducted from my account... even after 48 hours, I neither got the recharge nor a refund."
> "we are not mad, trying to do kyc but everytime there is technical error you should improve the app. can't keep on trying for this."

## Action Ideas
- 💡 Implement a dedicated, immediate channel (live chat/call) for users experiencing KYC roadblocks or account blocks.
- 💡 Investigate and resolve root causes for recurring UPI loading/failure errors following recent security updates.
- 💡 Streamline the NRI KYC process, potentially by offering in-house document translation services instead of demanding users provide certified translations.
