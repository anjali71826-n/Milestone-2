# Weekly Product Pulse: Focus on KYC, Payments, and Statements

## Overview
This week's feedback highlights critical friction points across KYC, Payments, and Statements. KYC processes are flagged for excessive waiting times and technical errors. Payment issues center on failed UPI transactions and unresolved mobile recharge failures resulting in debited funds. Statement users require more accurate return metrics (XIRR) and enhanced P&L visualization for improved portfolio clarity.

## Top 3 Themes
- **KYC (Process Delays & Technical Errors)**
- **Payments (UPI Failures & Recharge Issues)**
- **Statements (Return Metric Accuracy & UI Clarity)**

## User Quotes

## Action Ideas
- 💡 Conduct immediate audit of KYC verification pipeline to reduce technical errors and processing time below 24 hours.
- 💡 Investigate root cause of failed UPI transactions and pending mobile recharges to ensure atomic transaction processing or immediate reversal.
- 💡 Prioritize implementation of XIRR calculations for SIP investments and enhance the IND Stocks dashboard for clearer return visualization.
