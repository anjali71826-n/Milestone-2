# Weekly Product Pulse: Payments, KYC Friction & Onboarding Experience

## Overview
User feedback this week highlights significant friction points across key journey stages. Payments, particularly concerning failed transactions and mobile recharges, is a major concern. KYC processes, especially for US trading and reactivations, are causing significant delays and frustration. While Onboarding generally receives positive remarks for ease, payment-related onboarding issues persist.

## Top 3 Themes
- **Payments: Persistent issues with failed/stuck deposits, instant recharge failures, and confusion over instant deposit fees.**
- **KYC: Multiple reports of technical errors, slow reactivation processes, and difficulty completing US trading KYC.**
- **Onboarding: Generally positive initial experience, though UPI registration failures and login issues were noted.**

## User Quotes
> "My deposit has been stuck for 20+ days... No proper support, no resolution."
> "After 22 minutes waiting for verification I feel totally waist of time... not recommend."
> "I recharged my mobile using your app, but it showed “pending” even though the money was deducted from my account."

## Action Ideas
- 💡 Prioritize a deep-dive audit on the mobile recharge failure loop, focusing on pending states and customer communication.
- 💡 Investigate and streamline the US Federal Bank KYC flow, as it appears disproportionately complex compared to standard flows.
- 💡 Review KYC reactivation logic, aiming to reduce the stated 10-day resolution time to under 48 hours for dormant accounts.
