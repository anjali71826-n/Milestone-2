# Weekly Product Pulse: Focus on Payments Friction and Statement Accuracy

## Overview
This week's pulse highlights significant user friction across our top themes. Payments are plagued by transaction failures, pending statuses, and poor mobile recharge reliability, leading to strong negative sentiment and account closure threats. KYC processes, particularly for re-verification and document upload, remain cumbersome. Statement accuracy is also a concern, with users demanding XIRR calculation for mutual funds and better P&L reporting fidelity.

## Top 3 Themes
- **Payments: High incidence of failed/pending transactions (especially mobile recharge) and deposit delays.**
- **KYC: Difficulties with document uploads, verification timing, and complex processes for address/account changes.**
- **Statements: Demand for correct return metrics (XIRR over absolute %) and improved P&L/holding reports.**

## User Quotes
> "My deposit has been stuck for 20+ days, the app doesn’t allow me to upload the bank statement, and even after sending screen recordings, they kept giving copy-paste replies. No proper support, no resolution."
> "Mutual fund showing the absolute % rate which is not correct for SIP investment, it should show the XIRR returns..."
> "We are not mad, trying to do kyc but everytime there is technical error you should improve the app."

## Action Ideas
- 💡 Investigate and stabilize the UPI/Payment gateway reliability immediately, prioritizing resolution for stuck transactions.
- 💡 Streamline the KYC flow for address proof translation/verification for NRI/foreign documentation review.
- 💡 Implement XIRR calculation as a default or selectable option within Mutual Fund statement views.
